# Semester 4

This repository contains the assignments, lecture notes and handouts for the course CS202: Mathematics For Computer Science - II, taken by Prof. Anil Seth, during Spring 2024 Semester.




## Course Description

To provide students first introduction to mathematical logic with its past and present context and some (meta-)mathematical results. The emphasis will be on propositional languages. The course also aims to give some appreciation of a broad range of logics devised to reason in mathematics and outside it. [Course FCH]


## Topics Covered

- Natural Deduction (ND) rules and examples for Propositional Logic (PL). Minimal, intuitionistic and classical systems.

- Quantifiers, ND rules for quantifiers, Example deductions.
 
- Lattices, Boolean Algebra (BA), Semantics of classical PL. Soundness and completeness.

- Completeness of two element BA. Some representation results for BA. Normal forms: NNF, CNF DNF and prenex NF.

- Heyting Algebra, Definition and examples, Kripke structures.

- Non-classical logics
